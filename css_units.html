cm		santimetre  				1cm = 37.8px = 25.2/64in
mm		milimetre					1mm = 1/10th of 1cm
in		inç 						1in = 2.54cm = 96px
px		piksel						1px = 1/96th of 1in
pt		point						1pt = 1/72th of 1in
pc		picas						1pc = 1/6th of 1in , 12pt
Q		Quarter-millimeters			1Q  = 1/40th of 1cm

em		Font size of the parent, in the case of typographical properties like font-size, and font size of the element itself, in the case of other properties like width.
ex		Relative to height of the current font’s lowercase “x”.
ch		The advance measure (width) of the glyph "0" of the element's font. relative to width of the "0" (ZERO, U+0030) glyph in the element's font
rem		Relative to the font-size of the root (e.g. the <html> element). “rem” = “root em”
lh		Line height of the element.
rlh		Line height of the root element. When used on the font-size or line-height properties of the root element, it refers to the properties' initial value.
vw	  	Relative to the width of viewport. 1vw = 1/100 of the viewport’s width.
vh	  	Relative to the height of the viewport (window or app size). 1vh = 1/100 of the viewport’s height
vmin  	Relative to viewport’s smaller dimension (e.g. for portrait orientation, the width is smaller than the height so it’s relative to the width). 1vmin = 1/100 of viewport’s smaller dimension.
vmax  	Relative to viewport’s larger dimension (e.g. height for portrait orientation). 1vmax = 1/100 of viewport’s larger dimension.
vb		1% of the size of the initial containing block in the direction of the root element's block axis.
vi		1% of the size of the initial containing block in the direction of the root element's inline axis.
